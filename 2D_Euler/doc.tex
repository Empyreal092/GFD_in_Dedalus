We start with perhaps the most simple model of geophysical turbulence, 2D incompressible Euler. We can write the model in vorticity form \parencite[\S 4.2.1]{Vallis_17}:
\begin{align}
    &\frac{\DD \zeta}{\DD t} = 0,\\
    &\zeta = \nabla^2\psi,\\
    &u = -\frac{\pe\psi}{\pe y}, v = \frac{\pe\psi}{\pe x}.
\end{align}

There is no nondimensional number in this model. 

\section{Freely decaying simulation}
We run freely decaying simulation where we pick the initial energy containing scale of be around 1 and have a $10\times 10$ domain. We use $\nabla^8$ dissipation interpreted spectrally as $k^8+\ell^8$. 

Figure \ref{fig:2DEuler_zeta_t} shows the snap shots of vorticity and the streamfunction over the evolution of the simulation. We see a convincing inverse cascade and the formation of coherent vortices. Figure \ref{fig:2DEuler_energy} keep track of the kinetic energy and enstrophy. We see that, as expected, they experience a rapid initial decay. Afterwards, they are approximately conserved. Figure \ref{fig:2DEuler_spec} shows the evolution of the enstrophy spectra. The theoretical expectation is for them to have a $k^{-1}$ slope. We see that this is approximately true in early time. We also see that the hyper-dissipation is damping the small scale effectively.
